Ideas:

Non-Solid block that you go behind therefore its like going behind a beam

Some destructible tiles

Climable tiles

Dual state tiles ex. fire barrel and exploded fire barrel

Multiple charachter choices

Foreground specific to level.. if randomly generated use somesort of default foreground

shading as demonstrated in /res/ideas/shading.png

Draw backround image then draw main level over it then change transperant tiles to work like the player transparency

Attacking will be mouse controled however action button will be down button
