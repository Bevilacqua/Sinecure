Ideas:

Non-Solid block that you go behind therefore its like going behind a beam

Some destructible tiles

Climable tiles

Dual state tiles ex. fire barrel and exploded fire barrel

Multiple charachter choices

Foreground specific to level.. if randomly generated use somesort of default foreground

shading as demonstrated in /res/ideas/shading.png

Define (level-specific) where the ground level starts and say everything below this is one backround and above it is another (ex. terraria)
If anyone has an idea how to do this cleanly let me know i tried but it was such a mess i couldn't get it to work

Attacking will be mouse controled however action button will be down button
